*Emborg* is a simple command line utility to orchestrate backups. It is built as 
a front-end to Borg_, a powerful and fast deduplicating backup program.  With 
*Emborg*, you specify all the details about your backups once in advance, and 
then use a very simple command line interface for your day-to-day activities.  

Use of *Emborg* does not preclude the use of Borg directly on the same 
repository.  The philosophy of *Emborg* is to provide commands that you would 
use often and in an interactive manner with the expectation that you would use 
Borg directly for the remaining commands.

*Emborg* is not intended for use with *Borg* version 2.0 or later.  Instead, the 
successor to *Emborg* should be used: Assimilate_.


Getting Help
------------

You can find the documentation here: Emborg_.

The *help* command provides information on how to use Emborg's various
features.  To get a listing of the topics available, use::

    emborg help

Then, for information on a specific topic use::

    emborg help <topic>

It is worth browsing all of the available topics at least once to get a sense of
all that *Emborg* can do.
