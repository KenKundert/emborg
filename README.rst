*Emborg* is a simple command line utility to orchestrate backups. It is built as 
a front-end to Borg, a powerful and fast deduplicating backup program.  With 
*Emborg*, you specify all the details about your backups once in advance, and 
then use a very simple command line interface for your day-to-day activities.  

Use of *Emborg* does not preclude the use of Borg directly on the same 
repository.  The philosophy of *Emborg* is to provide commands that you would 
use often and in an interactive manner with the expectation that you would use 
Borg directly for the remaining commands.


Getting Help

It is worth browsing all of the available topics at least once to get a sense of
all that *Emborg* can do.
