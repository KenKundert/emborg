            Emborg is a simple command line utility to orchestrate backups.  It
            is built on Borg, which is a powerful and fast de-duplicating backup
            utility for managing encrypted backups, however it can be rather
            clumsy to use directly.  With Emborg, you specify all the details
            about your backups once in advance, and then use a very simple
            command line interface for your day-to-day activities.  The details
            are contained in ~/.config/emborg.  That directory will contain a
            file (settings) that contains shared settings, and then another file
            for each of your backup configurations.

            Use of Emborg does not preclude the use of Borg directly on the same
            repository.  The philosophy of Emborg is to provide commands that
            you would use often and in an interactive manner with the
            expectation that you would use Borg directly for the remaining
            commands.  In fact, Emborg provides the borg command to make that
            easier.

            """
            You should assure you have a backup copy of the encryption
            passphrase in a safe place.  This is very important. If the only
            copy of the passphrase is on the disk being backed up and that disk
            were to fail you would not be able to access your backups.
            I recommend the use of sparekeys (https://github.com/kalekundert/sparekeys)
            as a way of assuring that you always have access to the essential
            information, such as your Borg passphrase and keys, that you would
            need to get started after a catastrophic loss of your disk.

            In addition it is important to understand that your backup data is
            not encrypted with your passphrase, rather your passphrase encrypts
            a key, and your backup data is encrypted with the key.  Thus, your
            backup files cannot be decrypted without both the passphrase and the
            key.  If you choose encryption=repokey then Borg copies your key to
            the remote repository, so you do not need to keep a copy yourself.
            Using repokey is appropriate if you control the server that holds
            the remote repository.  If you choose encryption=keyfile, which is
            appropriate if you do not control the resository's server, then it
            does not copy the key to the repository, so it is essential
            that you export and keep a copy of the key in a safe place.
            Sparekeys can do this for you.

            If you keep the passphrase in a settings file, you should set
            its permissions so that it is not readable by others:

                chmod 700 ~/.config/emborg/settings

            Better yet is to simply not store the passphrase.  This can be
            arranged if you are using Avendesora
            (https://avendesora.readthedocs.io/en/stable), which is a flexible
            password management system. The interface to Avendesora is already
            built in to Emborg, but its use is optional (it need not be
            installed).

            It is also best, if it can be arranged, to keep your backups at a
            remote site so that your backups do not get destroyed in the same
            disaster, such as a fire or flood, that claims your original files.
            Some commercial options are:
                rsync.net (https://www.rsync.net/products/attic.html)
                BorgBase (https://www.borgbase.com)
                Hetzner (https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box)

            Finally, it is a good idea to practice a recovery. Pretend that you
            have lost all your files and then see if you can do a restore from
            backup. Doing this and working out the kinks before you lose your
            files can save you if you ever do lose your files.
