# when {{{1
def when(time, relative_to=None, as_past=None, as_future=None):
    """Converts time into a human friendly description of a time difference

    Takes a time and returns a string that is intended for people.  It is a
    short description of the time difference between the given time and the
    current time or a reference time.  It is like arrow.humanize(), but provides
    more resolution.  It is suitable for use with time differences that exceed
    1 second.  Any smaller than that will round to 0.

    Arguments:
        time (datetime):
            The time of the event. May either be in the future or the past.
        relative_to (datetime):
            Time to compare against to form the time difference.  If not given,
            the current time is used.
        as_ast (bool or str):
            If true, the word “ago” will be added to the end of the returned
            time difference if it is negative, indicating it occurred in the
            past.  It it a string, it should contain ‘{}’, which is replaced
            with the time difference.
        as_future (bool or str):
            If true, the word “in” will be added to the front of the returned
            time difference if it is positive, indicating it occurs in the
            past.  It it a string, it should contain ‘{}’, which is replaced
            with the time difference.
    Returns:
        A user friendly string that describes the time difference.

    Examples:

        >>> import arrow
        >>> now = arrow.now()
        >>> print(when(now.shift(seconds=60.1)))
        1 minute

        >>> print(when(now.shift(seconds=2*60), as_future=True))
        in 2 minutes

        >>> print(when(now.shift(seconds=-60*60), as_past=True))
        60 minutes ago

        >>> print(when(now.shift(seconds=3.5*60), as_future="{} from now"))
        3.5 minutes from now
